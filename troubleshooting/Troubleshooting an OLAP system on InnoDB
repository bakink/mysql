The default value of innodb_stats_persistent_sample_pages and innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages are 20 and 8 respectively, 
which is too low for our dataset, This works wells for smaller tables, but in our case tables are in few 100â€™s of GB. 
We increased the values below globally since its a dynamic variable by 10X approx.

mysql> set global innodb_stats_persistent_sample_pages=200;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> set global innodb_stats_transient_sample_pages=100;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
